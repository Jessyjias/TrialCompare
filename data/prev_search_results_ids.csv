1,NCT04282044,Unknown,Study of CRX100 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies,"This clinical study is an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the drug product produced by Administering CRX100 alone and in combination with Pembrolizumab in advanced solid malignancies. Patients will be screened and evaluated to determine whether or not they meet stated inclusion criteria. Enrolled subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable the ex vivo generation of CRX100. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), malignant melanoma (excluding uveal melanoma), gastric cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and osteosarcoma.

5. Subjects with Ovarian cancer must have received at least one prior standard of care for their relapsed or refractory disease, which must include a platinum-based regimen.
6. Subjects agree to provide fresh tumor tissue that has not been previously irradiated. If biopsy procedure is not safe to perform, then archival tumor tissue (20 slides or a tissue block) can be submitted.
7. Subjects must have iRECIST evaluable disease using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with IV contrast, with at least one measurable target lesion.
8. Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.

10. Adequate hematologic function at the time of screening, defined as: absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \>500 cells/mm3, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>750 cells/mm3, hemoglobin \>8 g/dL, and platelet count \>50,000 cells/mm3. For subjects enrolling into the LDC cohorts, the criteria are defined as: ALC\>500 cells/mm3, ANC\>1000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin\>8g/dL, and platelet count\>100,000 cells/mm3.

    a. Hemoglobin and platelet count thresholds must be achievable without transfusion of red blood cells or platelets, or use of growth factors administered within two weeks.

    2. Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin ≤1.5x institutional ULN; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5x institutional ULN, unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤5x ULN; International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤1.5.
