1,NCT03941730,Unknown,"Estradiol in Treating Patients With ER Beta Positive, Triple Negative Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer","This phase II trial studies how well estradiol works in treating patients with estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) positive, triple negative breast cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic). Hormone receptors like ER beta allow the body to respond appropriately to hormones. Triple negative means that the breast cancer does not express other hormone receptors called ER alpha, progesterone, and HER2. In some people with triple negative breast cancer, ER beta is overexpressed. Tumor cells that overexpress ER beta grow slower in the laboratory and this growth is slowed in the presence of estrogen. Estradiol is a form of estrogen. This study may help doctors determine whether tumor cells that overexpress ER beta shrink in the presence of estradiol.",ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,2019-08-28,"Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma, Anatomic Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Anatomic Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma, Recurrent Breast Carcinoma","Biopsy, Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography, Therapeutic Estradiol","Birmingham / Alabama / United States, San Francisco / California / United States, Washington / District of Columbia / United States, Jacksonville / Florida / United States, Chicago / Illinois / United States, Rochester / Minnesota / United States, Bronx / New York / United States, Seattle / Washington / United States, Seattle / Washington / United States",No contact listed,2024-04-30,2019-05-08,2024-03-15,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Inclusion Criteria:
