5,NCT06157892,Unknown,A Study of Disitamab Vedotin Alone or With Other Anticancer Drugs in Solid Tumors,"This clinical trial is studying solid tumor cancers. A solid tumor is one that starts in part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once they've grown bigger in one spot or spread to other parts of the body, they're harder to treat. This is called advanced or metastatic cancer.

Participants in this study must have breast cancer or gastric cancer. Participants must have tumors that have HER2 on them. This allows the cancer to grow more quickly or spread faster. There are few treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that express HER2.

This clinical trial uses an experimental drug called disitamab vedotin (DV). Disitamab vedotin is a type of antibody drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them.

This clinical trial uses a drug called tucatinib, which has been approved to treat cancer in the United States and some other countries. This drug is sold under the brand name TUKYSA®.

This study will test how safe and how well DV, with or without tucatinib, is for participants with solid tumors. This study will also test what side effects happen when participants take these drugs. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.",RECRUITING,2024-04-30,"Breast Neoplasms, Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma, HER2 Low Breast Neoplasms, HER2 Positive Breast Neoplasms, Stomach Neoplasms, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms","disitamab vedotin, tucatinib","Orange / California / United States, Grand Junction / Colorado / United States, Kansas City / Missouri / United States, Saint Louis / Missouri / United States, Reno / Nevada / United States, Farmington / New Mexico / United States, Nashville / Tennessee / United States",Seagen Trial Information Support -  CONTACT - 866-333-7436 - No Phone Ext - clinicaltrials@seagen.com,2030-01-31,2023-12-06,2024-05-14,INTERVENTIONAL,"PHASE1, PHASE2","Inclusion Criteria:

* The effects of ZEN00364 and abemaciclib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because BETi and CDKi-inhibiting agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men and women treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 weeks after completion of ZEN003694 and abemaciclib administration

  * For female subjects of child-bearing potentially receiving ZEN003694, hormonal means of birth control alone, such as oral, injectable, dermal, subdermal or topical contraceptives are NOT acceptable forms of birth control given that their efficacy has not been evaluated when given in combination with the investigational drugs. ""Adequate contraception"" is defined as the following:

    * Contraceptive methods with a failure rate of =\< 1% used in combination with the barrier method. The following contraceptive methods are acceptable to use in combination with the barrier method: intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine system (IUS), or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) that meet the \< 1% failure rate as stated in the product label. Note: Hormonal IUDs/OCPs may only be used if the following criteria are met: male condoms are required AND subjects are informed of the potential for reduced systemic hormone levels from the IUD/OCP when taking ZEN003694. Alternatively, male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. For this definition, ""documented"" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records
  * Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must use one of the following contraceptive methods:

    * Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia OR
    * Condom use PLUS partner use of a highly effective contraceptive (=\< 1% rate of failure per year) such as intrauterine device or system, or hormonal birth control such as contraceptive subdermal implant, combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive, injectable progestogen, contraceptive vaginal ring, or percutaneous contraceptive patches
  * Male subjects should not donate sperm while on study and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study medication. Male subjects whose partners are or become pregnant must continue to use condoms for 12 weeks after the last dose of study medication
* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of starting treatment
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694 and abemaciclib. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to: ongoing or active infection requiring systemic therapy, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment (e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \< 30ml/min), history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline grade 2 or higher diarrhea that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study
* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic windows are ineligible. Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. As proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids may alter the pharmacokinetics of ZEN003694 by reducing ZEN003694 exposure, patients receiving proton pump inhibitors are ineligible. If H2 blockers or other acid reducing agents are used concomitantly with ZEN003694, a staggered dosing schedule should be used. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZEN003694 is a BETi agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ZEN003694, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ZEN003694. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study
* Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) \>= 450 msec on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) (machine or manual read allowed). Patients should avoid medications which prolong the QT
* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are Factor Xa inhibitors (i.e., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban otamixaban, letaxaban, eribaxaban) or Factor IIa inhibitors (i.e., dabigatran). Low molecular weight heparin is allowed
* Patients with radiation to \> 25% of the bone marrow
* Patients who have had a bone-targeted radionuclide within 6 weeks of the first dose of ZEN003694

* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. A negative serum pregnancy test is required no more than 7 days before study entry.
* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).

Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \[anti-HBc\] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).
* The patient with a previous history of non-breast malignancy is eligible for this study only if the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer survivor is eligible provided the following criteria are met:

  * Patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies.
  * Patients have been considered disease free for at least 1 year (with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix).
* Patients with a strong likelihood of non-adherence (such as difficulties in adhering to follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the treatment facility) should not be knowingly registered.
* History of allogeneic organ transplantation.",ALL,18,18

15,NCT04588246,Unknown,Testing the Addition of Whole Brain Radiotherapy Using a Technique That Avoids the Hippocampus to Stereotactic Radiosurgery in People With Cancer That Has Spread to the Brain and Come Back in Other Areas of the Brain After Earlier Stereotactic Radiosurgery,"This phase III trial compares the effect of adding whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance and memantine to stereotactic radiosurgery versus stereotactic radiosurgery alone in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the brain and come back in other areas of the brain after earlier stereotactic radiosurgery. Hippocampus avoidance during whole-brain radiation therapy decreases the amount of radiation that is delivered to the hippocampus, which is a brain structure that is important for memory. The medicine memantine is also often given with whole brain radiation therapy because it may decrease the risk of side effects of radiation on thinking and memory. Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a high dose of radiation only to the small areas of cancer in the brain and avoids the surrounding normal brain tissue. Adding whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance and memantine to stereotactic radiosurgery may be effective in shrinking or stabilizing cancer that has spread to the brain and returned in other areas of the brain after receiving stereotactic radiosurgery.",RECRUITING,2020-12-15,"Anatomic Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Metastatic Breast Carcinoma, Metastatic Digestive System Carcinoma, Metastatic Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma, Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm in the Brain, Metastatic Melanoma, Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma, Prognostic Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Recurrent Brain Neoplasm, Stage IV Lung Cancer AJCC v8, Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer AJCC v8, Stage IVA Lung Cancer AJCC v8, Stage IVB Lung Cancer AJCC v8","Memantine, Quality-of-Life Assessment, Questionnaire Administration, Stereotactic Radiosurgery, Whole-Brain Radiotherapy","Tucson / Arizona / United States, Tucson / Arizona / United States, Corona / California / United States, Duarte / California / United States, Irvine / California / United States, Lancaster / California / United States, Roseville / California / United States, Roseville / California / United States, Sacramento / California / United States, South Pasadena / California / United States, Torrance / California / United States, Upland / California / United States, Newark / Delaware / United States, Newark / Delaware / United States, Newark / Delaware / United States, Newark / Delaware / United States, Coral Gables / Florida / United States, Deerfield Beach / Florida / United States, Jacksonville / Florida / United States, Miami / Florida / United States, Pembroke Pines / Florida / United States, Chicago / Illinois / United States, Chicago / Illinois / United States, Chicago / Illinois / United States, Danville / Illinois / United States, DeKalb / Illinois / United States, Effingham / Illinois / United States, Geneva / Illinois / United States, Mattoon / Illinois / United States, Urbana / Illinois / United States, Urbana / Illinois / United States, Warrenville / Illinois / United States, Baltimore / Maryland / United States, Baltimore / Maryland / United States, Bel Air / Maryland / United States, Columbia / Maryland / United States, Glen Burnie / Maryland / United States, Boston / Massachusetts / United States, Ann Arbor / Michigan / United States, Brighton / Michigan / United States, Chelsea / Michigan / United States, Chelsea / Michigan / United States, Ypsilanti / Michigan / United States, Jackson / Mississippi / United States, Creve Coeur / Missouri / United States, Saint Louis / Missouri / United States, Saint Louis / Missouri / United States, Saint Louis / Missouri / United States, Saint Peters / Missouri / United States, Lake Success / New York / United States, Rochester / New York / United States, Winston-Salem / North Carolina / United States, Bismarck / North Dakota / United States, Fargo / North Dakota / United States, Fargo / North Dakota / United States, Columbus / Ohio / United States, Oklahoma City / Oklahoma / United States, Chadds Ford / Pennsylvania / United States, Danville / Pennsylvania / United States, Greensburg / Pennsylvania / United States, Lewisburg / Pennsylvania / United States, Media / Pennsylvania / United States, Philadelphia / Pennsylvania / United States, Pittsburgh / Pennsylvania / United States, Pottsville / Pennsylvania / United States, Willow Grove / Pennsylvania / United States, Wynnewood / Pennsylvania / United States, York / Pennsylvania / United States, Charleston / South Carolina / United States, Greenville / South Carolina / United States, Lubbock / Texas / United States, Richmond / Virginia / United States, Morgantown / West Virginia / United States, Madison / Wisconsin / United States, Menomonee Falls / Wisconsin / United States, Milwaukee / Wisconsin / United States, Oak Creek / Wisconsin / United States, West Bend / Wisconsin / United States",No contact listed,2025-01-31,2020-10-19,2024-01-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,"Inclusion Criteria:

21,NCT05747794,AIPAC-003,Study in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Eftilagimod Alpha or Placebo in Combination With Paclitaxel Chemotherapy,"The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of eftilagimod alpha (efti) in combination with paclitaxel standard of care chemotherapy in participants with metastatic breast cancer.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the optimal biological dose (OBD) of efti in combination with weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy?
* Can efti combined with weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy prolong overall survival in participants with metastatic breast cancer if compared to weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy alone?

In the first component of the trial (phase 2, lead-in) researchers will compare two groups (different dose levels of efti in combination with standard chemotherapy) to see if the treatment is safe and well tolerated and evaluate which is the optimal biological dose. In the second component of the trial (phase 3) researchers will assess if the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with the optimal biological dose of efti in combination with paclitaxel is superior compared to chemotherapy alone (placebo-controlled).

The treatment concept of each trial component consists of a chemo-immunotherapy phase followed by an immunotherapy phase. In the first phase participants will be treated with efti plus paclitaxel chemotherapy or placebo plus paclitaxel chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Targeted therapy, such as Ipatasertib, may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The addition of ipatasertib to paclitaxel in solid tumors with an AKT genetic change could increase the percentage of tumors that shrink as well as lengthen the time that the tumors remain stable (without progression).

Ribociclib and tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast tumor cells. Fulvestrant blocks the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy.

The primary breast tumor must be palpable and measure greater than or equal 2.0 cm on physical exam.

The regional lymph nodes can be cN0, cN1, or cN2a.

Histological grade II or III tumor.

Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (mammogram, ultrasound, and/or MRI) within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy. If suspicious or abnormal, FNA or core biopsy is recommended, also within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy. Findings of these evaluations will be used to determine the nodal status prior to initiating chemotherapy.

* Nodal status - negative: Imaging of the axilla is negative; Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but the FNA or core biopsy of the questionable node(s) on imaging is negative;
* Nodal status - positive: FNA or core biopsy of the node(s) is cytologically or histologically suspicious or positive. Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but FNA or core biopsy was not performed.

Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have ER and progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis assessed by current ASCO/CAP Guidelines. Patients are eligible with either hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-negative tumors.

Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have been determined to be HER2-negative as follows:

* Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+; or
* IHC 2+ and in situ hybridization (ISH) non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) less than 2.0, and if reported, average HER2 gene copy number less than 4 signals/cells; or
* ISH non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to CEP17 less than 2.0, and if reported, average HER2 gene copy number less than 4 signals/cells.

Blood counts performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must meet the following criteria:

* absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal 1200/mm3;
* platelet count must be greater than or equal 100,000/mm3; and
* hemoglobin must be greater than or equal 10 g/dL.

The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must be met:

* total bilirubin must be less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and
* alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and
* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.
* Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, the AST must be less than or equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, the alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to ULN. Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.

Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT, or PET scan) performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements in next criteria are met.

Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN or unexplained bone pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT scan, or positron emission tomography (PET) scan performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease.

Serum creatinine performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.

The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan performed within 90 days prior to initiating chemotherapy must be greater than or equal 55 percent regardless of the facility's lower limit of normal (LLN).

Patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during therapy and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study

HIV positive patients with T-cell (CD4+) counts ≥350 cells/mL and not receiving treatment or does not plan to be treated with antiretroviral medication will be eligible for the study. Testing for seropositive status during screening will be at the discretion of the investigator in patients without previously reported results.
15. Active hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.

    * Patients will be tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) at Screening.
    * Patients with hepatitis B (HepBsAg+) who have controlled infection (serum hepatitis B virus DNA level is below the limit of detection by PCR) may be enrolled into the study. Subjects with controlled infections must undergo periodic monitoring of HBV DNA per treating physician.
    * Patients with hepatitis C (HCV Ab+) who have controlled infection (undetectable HCV RNA by PCR either spontaneously or in response to a successful prior course of anti-HCV therapy) may be enrolled into the study. Patients with controlled infections must undergo periodic monitoring of HCV RNA per treating physician.
16. Presence of other active cancers, or history of treatment for invasive cancer ≤3 years. Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local treatment and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible. All patients with previously treated in situ carcinoma (ie, non-invasive) are eligible, as are patients with history of non-melanoma skin cancer.
17. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the protocol.
18. Routine use of corticosteroids or erythrocyte-stimulating factors as well as prophylactic use of colony-stimulating factors.
19. Use of any strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or strong inducer drugs ≤28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of CPO-100. For CYP3A4 inducer drugs for which 5 half-lives is ≤28 days, a minimum of 14 days between discontinuation of the drug and administration of CPO-100 is required.
20. Use of herbal preparations/medications including, but are not limited to: St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng. A minimum of 14 days between discontinuation of the herbal preparation/medications and administration of CPO-100 is required.",ALL,18,18

59,NCT05929768,Unknown,Shorter Chemo-Immunotherapy Without Anthracycline Drugs for Early-Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"This phase III trial compares the effects of shorter chemotherapy (chemo)-immunotherapy without anthracyclines to usual chemo-immunotherapy for the treatment of early-stage triple negative breast cancer. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy drug that damages DNA and may kill cancer cells.

Hormone receptors like ER beta allow the body to respond appropriately to hormones. Triple negative means that the breast cancer does not express other hormone receptors called ER alpha, progesterone, and HER2. In some people with triple negative breast cancer, ER beta is overexpressed. Tumor cells that overexpress ER beta grow slower in the laboratory and this growth is slowed in the presence of estrogen. Estradiol is a form of estrogen.

101,NCT05807074,Unknown,Impact of Topical Tranexamic Acid in Breast Reconstruction,"Improvement in bleeding and bruising has been described by using both intravenous and topical off-label applications of Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in many surgical fields. This trial tests how well applying tranexamic acid (TXA) to the surface of the surgical site (topically) works to reduce post-operative bleeding (hematomas) and fluid collections (seromas) in women undergoing surgery to remove both breasts (bilateral mastectomy) immediately followed by surgery to rebuild the breast (reconstruction). The formation of hematomas and seromas, a common post-mastectomy complication, can interfere with breast reconstruction and increase the risk of infection and wound healing and can potentially delay cancer treatments. TXA is a synthetic molecule that pushes the body's clotting cascade toward clot formation to improve blood clotting. Applying TXA topically to the surgical site before closing the incision may prevent hematoma and seroma formation in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction patients.

4.2.1. ctDNA positivity by the Signatera assay, defined as 2 of the 16 cancer specific markers positive in plasma.

4.2.2. Patients with positive Signatera results obtained in the context of commercial testing, outside of the screening phase of this trial, are also eligible for randomization if they meet other eligibility criteria.

4.2.3. No evidence of metastatic disease on CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.

* If imaging, after review with a radiologist, is low probability for metastatic disease, patients may proceed to randomization.
* Patients with suspicious but inconclusive imaging results should undergo a diagnostic biopsy, if biopsy is negative patients are eligible for randomization.
* Patients with positive imaging that is conclusive of metastatic disease, or with biopsy proven metastatic disease, are not eligible for randomization.

4.2.4. Pre-menopausal women and male patients must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the duration of trial treatment and for 4 additional weeks after completion of treatment in the control arm, and for 2 years after the last dose of fulvestrant, if randomized into the experimental arm.

Post-menopausal status is defined as:

* Documented bilateral oophorectomy.
* Age ≥ 60 years.
* Age \< 60 years and amenorrhoeic for ≥ 12 consecutive months and FSH and estradiol levels in the post-menopausal range according to the institutional reference range for post-menopausal.

Adequate contraception is defined as ONE highly effective form (i.e. abstinence, surgical sterilization through bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy), or TWO effective forms (e.g. non-hormonal IUD and condom / occlusive cap with spermicidal foam / gel / film / cream / suppository).

- Abstinence is to be interpreted as ""true abstinence"" for heterosexual intercourse and therefore, ""periodic abstinence"" (e.g. calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal (coitus interruptus) are not considered highly effective.

Exclusion Criteria

4.1.5. Prior or current treatment with fulvestrant, or current treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, or treatment in the prior 12 months, or participants in the PENELOPE and PALLAS clinical trials.

4.1.6. Patients cannot start participation in another therapeutic clinical trial for breast cancer after enrollment in this trial.

4.1.7. Patients with current or past invasive cancer, other than breast cancer are not eligible, except:

* Adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are eligible.
* Cancer survivors of previously diagnosed invasive cancer, who were treated with a curative intent, have no evidence of disease recurrence for 5 years or more, and are considered low risk for future recurrence by the treating physician are also eligible.

4.1.8. Patients with a second HER2 positive or triple negative synchronous breast cancer are not eligible.

Exclusion criteria for randomization

4.2.5. Patients with known contraindications to receive fulvestrant and palbociclib or those who are unable to tolerate these drugs are not eligible.

* Absolute neutrophil count less than \<1000/mm3;

113,NCT05455619,Amelia-1,Evexomostat Plus Alpelisib and Fulvestrant in Women With the PIK3CA Mutation With HR+/Her2- Breast Cancer,"The PIK3CA gene is frequently mutated in breast cancer, leading to disease aggressiveness and patient mortality. Alpelisib, a small molecule that inhibits the activity of the PIK3CA gene product PI3Kα, has demonstrated clinical benefit in cancer patients with this gene mutation. However, hyperglycemia, an on-target toxicity associated with alpelisib that leads to hyperinsulinemia, limits the drug's clinical efficacy and induces high grade hyperglycemia in patients with baseline metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance and/or elevated HbA1c. Restoring insulin sensitivity and reduction in circulating concentrations of insulin have been reported to improve the activity of alpelisib.

Evexomostat (SDX-7320) is a polymer-conjugate of a novel small molecule methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibitor that has demonstrated the ability to reduce alpelisib-induced hyperglycemia in multiple animal experiments and has demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor activity independent of changes in glucose or insulin. Evexomostat was well tolerated in a Phase 1 safety study in late-stage cancer patients and showed improvements in insulin resistance for patients that presented with baseline elevated insulin. Overall, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events with evexomostat (TEAEs) were fatigue (44%), decreased appetite (38%), constipation and nausea (each 28%), and diarrhea (22%). All other TEAEs occurred at an incidence \<20%.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety of the triplet drug combination (alpelisib, fulvestrant plus evexomostat), to test whether evexomostat, when given in combination with alpelisib and fulvestrant will reduce the number and severity of hyperglycemic events and/or reduce the number of anti-diabetic medications needed to control the hyperglycemia for patients deemed at risk for alpelisib-induced hyperglycemia (baseline elevated HbA1c or well-controlled type 2 diabetes), and to assess preliminary anti-tumor efficacy and changes in key biomarkers and quality of life in this patient population.",RECRUITING,2022-08-26,"HR+/HER2-negative Breast Cancer, Metastatic Breast Cancer",Evexomostat,"Loma Linda / California / United States, Los Angeles / California / United States, Newport / California / United States, Miami / Florida / United States, Baltimore / Maryland / United States, Toledo / Ohio / United States, Nashville / Tennessee / United States",David Browning -  CONTACT - +1-615-975-7776 - No Phone Ext - dbrowning@syndevrx.com,2026-03,2022-07-13,2024-03-04,INTERVENTIONAL,"PHASE1, PHASE2","Inclusion:

  * Pathologic staging of pN0(i+) or pN0(mol+), pN1, pN2, or pN3 disease.
  * Patient had a mastectomy.
  * Palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or contralateral axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes, unless there is histologic confirmation that these nodes are negative for tumor.
  * Suspicious microcalcifications, densities, or palpable abnormalities (in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast) unless biopsied and found to be benign.
  * Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma.
  * Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive cancer or DCIS) in more than one quadrant or separated by 4 or more centimeters. (Patients with multifocal carcinoma are eligible.)
  * Paget's disease of the nipple.
  * Any history, not including the index cancer, of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer or ipsilateral DCIS treated or not treated. (Patients with synchronous or previous ipsilateral LCIS are eligible.)
  * Synchronous or previous contralateral invasive breast cancer or DCIS. (Patients with synchronous and/or previous contralateral LCIS are eligible.)
  * Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are positive at pathologic evaluation. (If surgical margins are rendered free of disease by re- excision, the patient is eligible.)
  * Treatment plan that includes regional nodal irradiation.
  * Any treatment with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or biotherapy, administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to pre-entry/Step 1.
  * History of non-breast malignancies (except for in situ cancers treated only by local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 5 years prior to pre-entry/Step 1.
  * Current therapy with any endocrine therapy such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention.

    \*\* Patients are eligible for BR007 if they receive a short course of preoperative endocrine therapy of less than 6 weeks duration (prior to randomization/Step 2) for this diagnosis after the core biopsy (and can continue postoperatively if:
  * the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score is assessed on the biopsy core and is less than or equal to 18, AND
  * the patient had not initiated endocrine therapy prior to core biopsy tissue collection.

    \*\*\* This does not apply to adjuvant endocrine therapy recommended for this diagnosis which may start any time after surgery including prior to registration (Pre-entry/Step 1).
  * Patients intending to continue on oral, transdermal, or subdermal estrogen replacement (including all estrogen only and estrogen-progesterone formulas) are not eligible. Patients that discontinue oral, transdermal, or subdermal estrogen replacement prior to registration are eligible.
  * Prior breast or thoracic RT for any condition.
  * Active collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a CPK level above normal or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosis, or scleroderma.
  * Pregnancy or lactation at the time of pre-entry/Step 1 or intention to become pregnant during treatment. (Note: Pregnancy testing according to institutional standards for women of childbearing potential must be performed within 2 weeks prior to pre-entry/Step 1.)
  * Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of study therapy or that may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications.
  * Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements or interfere with interpretation of study results.
  * Use of any investigational product within 30 days prior to pre-entry/Step 1.",ALL,50,70
118,NCT04197687,Unknown,"TPIV100 and Sargramostim for the Treatment of HER2 Positive, Stage II-III Breast Cancer in Patients With Residual Disease After Chemotherapy and Surgery","This phase II trial studies how well TPIV100 and sargramostim work in treating patients with HER2 positive, stage II-III breast cancer that has residual disease after chemotherapy prior to surgery. It also studies why some HER2 positive breast cancer patients respond better to chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. TPIV100 is a type of vaccine made from HER2 peptide that may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express HER2. Sargramostim increases the number of white blood cells in the body following chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and is used to alert the immune system. It is not yet known if TPIV100 and sargramostim will work better in treating patients with HER2 positive, stage II-III breast cancer.",RECRUITING,2020-02-20,"Breast Adenocarcinoma, Stage II Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7, Stage IIA Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7, Stage IIB Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7, Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC v7, Stage IIIA Breast Cancer AJCC v7, Stage IIIB Breast Cancer AJCC v7, Stage IIIC Breast Cancer AJCC v7","Multi-epitope HER2 Peptide Vaccine TPIV100, Pertuzumab, Placebo Administration, Sargramostim, Trastuzumab, Trastuzumab Emtansine","Scottsdale / Arizona / United States, Tucson / Arizona / United States, Tucson / Arizona / United States, Yuma / Arizona / United States, Duarte / California / United States, La Jolla / California / United States, Middletown / Connecticut / United States, Gainesville / Florida / United States, Jacksonville / Florida / United States, West Palm Beach / Florida / United States, Atlanta / Georgia / United States, Peoria / Illinois / United States, Urbana / Illinois / United States, Sioux City / Iowa / United States, New Orleans / Louisiana / United States, Baltimore / Maryland / United States, Duluth / Minnesota / United States, Rochester / Minnesota / United States, Saint Cloud / Minnesota / United States, Saint Louis / Missouri / United States, Omaha / Nebraska / United States, Lebanon / New Hampshire / United States, Pinehurst / North Carolina / United States, Sayre / Pennsylvania / United States, West Columbia / South Carolina / United States, Nashville / Tennessee / United States, Falls Church / Virginia / United States, Eau Claire / Wisconsin / United States, Green Bay / Wisconsin / United States, Madison / Wisconsin / United States",No contact listed,2025-01-15,2019-12-13,2023-12-18,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Inclusion Criteria:

121,NCT06105632,Unknown,"A Study to Learn About the Study Medicine Called PF-07220060 in Combination With Fulvestrant in People With HR-positive, HER2-negative Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Progressed After a Prior Line of Treatment","The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and how effective the study medicine (PF-07220060) plus fulvestrant is compared to the study doctor's choice of treatment in people with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Advanced cancer is the one that is unlikely to be cured or taken care of with treatment. Metastatic cancer is the one that has spread to other parts of the body.

This study is seeking female and male participants who:

* are 18 years of age or older;
* are hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative;
* have advanced or metastatic breast cancer after taking other treatments before this study;
* have not taken or need to take medications that are not allowed by the study protocol;
* do not have any medical or mental conditions that may increase the risk of study participation.

Half of the participants will take PF-07220060 two times daily by mouth along with fulvestrant. Fulvestrant will be given as a shot into the muscle. The other half will take the study doctor's choice of treatment which can either be:

* Fulvestrant alone taken as shot into the muscle.
* Everolimus along with exemestane taken once daily by mouth.

This study will compare the experiences of participants receiving the study medicine plus fulvestrant to those who are receiving the study doctor's choice of treatment. This will help decide if the study medicine is safe and effective.

Participants will receive study treatment and/or will be in the study until:

* imaging scans (such as an MRI and/or CT) show that their cancer is getting worse.
* the study doctor thinks the participant is no longer benefitting from the study medicine.
* has side effects that become too severe. A side effect is a reaction (expected or unexpected) to a medicine or treatment you take.
* the participant chooses to stop taking part.",RECRUITING,2024-01-09,Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer,"PF-07220060 CDK4 inhibitor, Fulvestrant, Everolimus, Exemestane","Torrance / California / United States, Torrance / California / United States, Torrance / California / United States, Torrance / California / United States, Torrance / California / United States, Danbury / Connecticut / United States, Norwalk / Connecticut / United States, Washington / District of Columbia / United States, Washington / District of Columbia / United States, Savannah / Georgia / United States, Evanston / Illinois / United States, Skokie / Illinois / United States, Skokie / Illinois / United States, Billings / Montana / United States, Billings / Montana / United States, Poughkeepsie / New York / United States, Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires / Buenos Aires / Argentina, La Rioja / No State / Argentina, Rosslea / Queensland / Australia, Townsville / Queensland / Australia, Porto Alegre / RIO Grande DO SUL / Brazil, Fredericton / New Brunswick / Canada, Haifa / Hatsafon / Israel, Jerusalem / Yerushalayim / Israel, Suita / Osaka / Japan, Incheon / Incheon-gwangyeoksi [incheon] / Korea, Republic of, Seoul / Seoul-teukbyeolsi [seoul] / Korea, Republic of, Seoul / Seoul-teukbyeolsi [seoul] / Korea, Republic of, Seoul / Seoul-teukbyeolsi [seoul] / Korea, Republic of, Daegu / Taegu-kwangyǒkshi / Korea, Republic of, Taipei / No State / Taiwan, Taipei / No State / Taiwan",Pfizer CT.gov Call Center -  CONTACT - 1-800-718-1021 - No Phone Ext - ClinicalTrials.gov_Inquiries@pfizer.com,2025-12-16,2023-10-27,2024-04-03,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,"Inclusion Criteria:

127,NCT05673200,Unknown,"Testing the Addition of an Anti-cancer Drug, ASTX727 (Cedazuridine, Decitabine), to Chemotherapy (Paclitaxel) and Immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab) for Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer","This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of ASTX727 when given in combination with a usual approach of treatment with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab in patients with triple-negative breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer. The usual approach for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who are not in a study is chemotherapy with drugs like paclitaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. There is a protein called PD-L1 that helps regulate the body's immune system. For patients who have PD-L1+ tumors, immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is usually added to paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine as initial treatment. For patients who have PD-L1-negative tumors, chemotherapy alone is used, without immunotherapy. ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ASTX727 with usual treatment approach with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab may be able to shrink or stabilize the tumor for longer than the usual approach alone in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.",RECRUITING,2023-09-25,"Anatomic Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Anatomic Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma, Unresectable Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma","Biopsy, Biospecimen Collection, Computed Tomography, Decitabine and Cedazuridine, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Paclitaxel, Pembrolizumab","Phoenix / Arizona / United States, Costa Mesa / California / United States, Orange / California / United States, Sacramento / California / United States, Jacksonville / Florida / United States, Rochester / Minnesota / United States, Columbus / Ohio / United States, Oklahoma City / Oklahoma / United States, Pittsburgh / Pennsylvania / United States",No contact listed,2027-02-23,2023-01-06,2024-05-08,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,"Inclusion Criteria:

* For enrollment to Dose Finding Cohort: Availability and willingness to provide archival tumor tissue as required per protocol.
* For enrollment to Dose Expansion Cohort: (i) Willingness to provide baseline and 3-week tumor tissue biopsy specimens. (ii) Patients must have a measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.
* The effects of ASTX727 and pembrolizumab (MK-3475) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because these agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody agent, ASTX727 is a hypomethylating agent, and paclitaxel is a class D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab (MK-3475), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 180 days after completion of study treatment.

137,NCT03598257,Unknown,Radiation Therapy With or Without Olaparib in Treating Patients With Inflammatory Breast Cancer,"This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy with or without olaparib works in treating patients with inflammatory breast cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy with or without olaparib may work better in treating patients with inflammatory breast cancer.",RECRUITING,2019-01-18,Breast Inflammatory

* Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be exception to this rule. Subjects that require inhaled steroid or local steroid injections will not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism not from autoimmune disease and stable on hormone replacement will not be excluded from the study. Note: Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.
* Has had an allogenic tissue / solid organ transplant.
* Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT).
* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.
* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
* Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit (Visit 1) through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.",ALL,18,18

* Renal dysfunction that requires dialysis
* A major surgical procedure unrelated to breast cancer within 28 days prior to randomization
* A serious infection requiring oral or IV antibiotics within 14 days prior to screening or other clinically significant infection (e.g., COVID-19) within 14 days prior to screening
* Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes an individual's safe participation in and completion of the study
* Unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol in the opinion of the investigator

Substudy Exclusion Criteria:

T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called DM1. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors, and delivers DM1 to kill them. Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving T-DM1 and tucatinib may work better in preventing breast cancer from relapsing in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer compared to T-DM1 alone.",RECRUITING,2021-01-06,"Anatomic Stage IA

* HER2-positive status will be based on pretreatment biopsy material and defined as an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ and/or positive by in situ hybridization (ISH) according to current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Central testing is not required

  \* Known hormone receptor (HR) status as defined by ASCO/CAP guidelines (based on pretreatment biopsy material). Hormone receptor positive status can be determined by either known positive estrogen receptor (ER) or known positive progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor negative status must be determined by both known negative ER and known negative PR
* Patients with clinical stage T1-4, N0-3 disease at presentation and residual invasive disease postoperatively as defined above are eligible. (Note: Patients with T1a/bN0 tumors are not eligible at initial breast cancer diagnosis are not eligible)
* Patients with residual HR-negative, HER2 positive (+) disease in the breast and/or lymph nodes per the surgical pathology report are eligible; however, patients with HR+ HER2+ cancers must have node-positive residual disease per the surgical pathology report in order to qualify for the study. The presence of residual invasive disease in the breast is not mandatory for these patients
* Patients with weakly ER-positive (1-10%) breast cancer (based on the pretreatment core biopsy) are eligible even if they have node-negative disease per the surgical pathology report
* The residual disease tissue (breast and/or lymph nodes) is not required to be HER2-positive, as eligibility for NCI-2020-03770 (A011801) is based on a positive HER2 status at the time of the initial breast cancer diagnosis

  \* Note: The presence of micrometastases in lymph nodes after preoperative therapy counts as residual disease, whereas the presence of isolated tumor cells does not
* Patients with synchronous bilateral invasive disease are eligible provided both lesions were confirmed to be HER2-positive, and at least one of the lesions meets the criteria outlined above. Multifocal disease is allowed, as long as the largest biopsied breast tumor was HER2-positive
* Patients must have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with one of the following regimens: docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (THP), paclitaxel/methotrexate/cisplatin (TMP), doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (AC-TH(P)); docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (TCH(P)); fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide-docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (FAC-TH(P)), or fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide-docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (FEC-TH(P)). Note: apart from TCHP, where T is docetaxel, treatment with docetaxel or paclitaxel is acceptable
* Prior receipt of T-DM1 in the neoadjuvant setting is not allowed.

  * Prior treatment must have consisted of \>= 6 cycles of chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy, with a total duration of \>= 12 weeks, including at least 9 weeks of preoperative taxane and trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab (or Food and Drug Administration \[FDA\]-approved biosimilars). Patients who have received at least 9 weeks of preoperative taxane, pertuzumab and margetuximab are also eligible if they received \>= 6 cycles of systemic therapy prior to enrollment. Note: Patients who complete at least nine of a planned twelve doses of weekly paclitaxel, or three of a planned four doses of docetaxel, but discontinue prematurely due to toxicity are eligible. Patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy regimens are also eligible. Prior use of nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) instead of paclitaxel or docetaxel is permitted. Prior use of subcutaneous trastuzumab (Hylecta) and subcutaneous trastuzumab and pertuzumab (Phesgo) is also allowed.
  * Patients who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy which included experimental HER2-targeted therapy/therapies are potentially eligible, as long as the investigational agent was not a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (e.g. T-DM1, DS-8201a \[trastuzumab deruxtecan\]) or a HER2 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g. tucatinib, lapatinib, neratinib).
* Patients may have received =\< 1 cycles of T-DM1 in the adjuvant setting. Note: These patients will be randomized to receive a further 14 cycles of T-DM1 and tucatinib/placebo as tolerated. The most recent cycle of T-DM1 should have been administered =\< 5 weeks prior to registration

  \* Note: Both of the following two criteria need to be met for the patient to be eligible for this study
  * An interval of no more than 12 weeks between the completion date of the last definitive treatment (e.g. postoperative chemotherapy or radiation, or if neither given, breast surgical date) and the date of registration. Concurrent radiation therapy is permitted while receiving study treatment
  * Patients must be registered on study within =\< 180 days of the date of the most recent definitive breast cancer surgery (not including reconstructive surgery)
* All systemic chemotherapy should have been completed preoperatively unless participating in EA1181 (CompassHER2 pathologic complete response \[pCR\]) or the BIG DECRESCENDO Trial (which is very similar to CompassHER2 pCR in terms of study design, drugs, and eligibility). However, patients who received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant THP off study can receive a further 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy postoperatively to meet eligibility for A011801. Patients who participated in EA1181 or MA41 and proceeded to surgery immediately after the de-escalated trial regimen must receive postoperative chemotherapy to complete a total of \>= 6 cycles of systemic treatment prior to enrollment on A011801, as outlined above (e.g. 4 cycles pre-operatively, and 2 cycles post-operatively). The postoperative chemotherapy regimen prescribed is at the discretion of the treating oncologist (i.e. 2-4 cycles AC or THP, other). Continuation of trastuzumab + pertuzumab (HP) pre- or post-operatively as maintenance therapy (while awaiting a surgical date or an official pathology report) is allowed for all study participants
* Toxicities related to prior systemic treatment should have resolved or be at baseline, apart from alopecia and peripheral neuropathy =\< grade 1
* Adequate excision: surgical removal of all clinically evident disease in the breast and lymph nodes as follows:

  * Breast surgery: total mastectomy with no gross residual disease at the margin of resection, or breast-conserving surgery with histologically negative margins of excision
  * For patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. Patients with margins positive for classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection
  * Lymph node surgery \*\* The axilla needs to be evaluated with either sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection. If patients have a sentinel lymph node biopsy and sentinel nodes are negative, no further axillary treatment is necessary. If patients have isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in the setting of residual breast disease, at least one of the following is required: axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or planned nodal irradiation. If patients have micro- or macro-metastatic nodal disease, ALND and planned nodal irradiation are required. Of note, co-enrollment on Alliance A011202 is not allowed
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>= 1,000/mm\^3
* Hemoglobin \>= 8 g/dL (Note: packed red blood cells \[PRBC\] transfusion is not permitted to achieve eligibility)
* Platelet count \>= 100,000/mm\^3
* Creatinine =\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
* Total bilirubin =\< 1.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or direct bilirubin within the institutional normal range for patients with Gilbert's syndrome

The study agent is called IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells. T cells are a special type of white blood cell (immune cells) that have the ability to kill tumor cells. The T cells are obtained from the patients own blood, grown in a laboratory, and modified by adding the IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene. The IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene is inserted into T cells with a virus called a lentivirus. The lentivirus allows cells to make the IL13Ralpha2 CAR protein. This CAR has been designed to bind to a protein on the surface of tumor cells called IL13Ralpha2. This study is being done to determine the dose at which the gene-modified immune cells are safe, how long the cells stay in the body, and if the cells are able to attack the cancer.",RECRUITING,2019-11-27,"Clinical Stage IV Cutaneous Melanoma AJCC v8, IL13RA2 Positive, Metastatic Melanoma, Cutaneous Melanoma, Stage III, Cutaneous Melanoma, Stage IV, Melanoma, Uveal Melanoma, Acral Melanoma, Neuroendocrine Tumors, Paraganglioma, Adrenocortical Carcinoma, Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor, Thyroid Cancer, Breast Cancer, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Refractory Malignant Solid Neoplasm, Recurrent Malignant Solid Neoplasm, Pheochromocytoma","Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine Phosphate, IL13Ralpha2-specific Hinge-optimized 4-1BB-co-stimulatory CAR/Truncated CD19-expressing Autologous TN/MEM Cells, Recombinant Interleukin-2","Duarte / California / United States, Los Angeles / California / United States",Jacob Naparstek -  CONTACT - 310-206-9926 - No Phone Ext - JNaparstek@mednet.ucla.edu,2024-10-01,2019-10-08,2024-05-15,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,"Inclusion Criteria:

Fisetin is a natural substance found in strawberries and other foods and is available as a nutritional supplement. Nutritional supplements may be useful in eliminating cells that have undergone a process called senescence. Senescence is when a cell ages and permanently stops dividing but does not die. Over time, large numbers of these cells build up in tissues throughout the body and can release harmful substances that cause inflammation and damage nearby healthy cells.

Fisetin is a naturally occurring substance that is found in strawberries and other foods. Fisetin eliminates cells that have undergone a process called senescence. Senescence is when a cell ages and permanently stops dividing but does not die. Over time, large numbers of these cells build up in tissues throughout the body and can release harmful substances that causes inflammation and damages nearby healthy cells. Studies have shown that chemotherapy causes a build-up of these senescent cells.

5. For Cohort 1, 2, 3A, patients should have an unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that is refractory to standard therapies, or have no standard therapies, or standard treatment is not applicable at this stage. For other cohorts, prior lines of therapy as below:

   Cohort 3B: EGFR wild-type NSCLC: Patients have received platinum-containing chemotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies as the only prior line of therapy; Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant system therapy/ radical chemoradiotherapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 6 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.

   Cohort 4: GC or GEJC: Patients who have been treated with only one prior therapy of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies therapy and progressed during or after treatment. Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant system therapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 6 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.

   Cohort 5: Second-line ES-SCLC: Patients who must have progressed on or after treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies administrated as part of first-line platinum-based systemic therapy for ES-SCLC. Previously treated limited stage SCLC will not be eligible.

   Cohort 6: HR+/ HER2-BC : Patients who have received previously at least two and no more than four lines of chemotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease with at least one taxane-containing in any setting. Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patients progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 12 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Patients should also have previously presented a progression on anticancer hormonal therapy with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and/ or a relapse during or after adjuvant endocrine therapy combined with an approved CDK4/6 inhibitor in this setting. Note: 1) Patients with HR+/HER2-BC and visceral crisis will be excluded. 2) For patients who have known BRCA mutation and HR+/HER2-BC, prior PARP inhibitor is required before enrolled in this study (where available and not medically contraindicated). 3) For patients with unknown BRCA status, prior PARP inhibitor is not required. 4) Patients who previously received therapy with an anti- HER2 ADC (T-Dxd) for HER2 low expressing tumors are eligible and this therapy will count as one chemotherapy line for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.

   Cohort 7: HNSCC: Patients who have been previously treated with therapy of anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies (either as a single-agent or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy) as first-line treatment in recurrent/metastatic (R/M) setting and progressed during or after treatment. Prior definitive/multimodal therapy for locally advanced (LA) HNSCC that included anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and platinum therapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed during or within 6 months of completing definitive therapy.

   Cohort 8: Endometrial cancer: Patients who have previously failed with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy; patients with microsatellite stability/non-mismatch repair deficiency (MSS/pMMR) endometrial carcinoma must have received prior platinum-based therapy and progressed during or after treatment. Patients with known high microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficiency (MSI-H/dMMR) endometrial carcinoma must have received prior platinum-based therapy and anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies therapy and progressed during or after treatment. Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 12 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Note: 1) If anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies therapy is not approved for second-line treatment for MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer patients in certain regions, prior treatment with anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies is not required. 2) If MMR/MSI status is unknown, patients who have been only treated with platinum based therapy is acceptable.

   Cohort 9: UC: Patients who have failed with prior first-line platinum-based therapy and received prior anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies therapy and progressed during or after the latest treatment.

162,NCT03975647,Unknown,A Study of Tucatinib vs. Placebo in Combination With Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) for Patients With Advanced or Metastatic HER2+ Breast Cancer,"This study is being done to see if tucatinib with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) works better than T-DM1 alone to help patients who have a specific type of breast cancer called HER2 positive breast carcinoma. The breast cancer in this study is either metastatic (spread into other parts of the body) or cannot be removed completely with surgery.

Patients in this study will be randomly assigned to get either tucatinib or placebo (a pill with no medicine). This is a blinded study, so neither patients nor their doctors will know whether a patient gets tucatinib or placebo. All patients in the study will get T-DM1, a drug that is often used to treat this cancer.

Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days. Patients will swallow tucatinib pills or placebo pills two times every day. Patients will get T-DM1 injections from the study site staff on the first day of every cycle.",RECRUITING,2019-10-02,HER2-positive Breast Cancer,"tucatinib, placebo, T-DM1","Mobile / Alabama / United

163,NCT05967533,Unknown,The Immune Effects of Fermented Wheat Germ Nutritional Supplementation in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Cancers Being Treated With Standard of Care Checkpoint Inhibitors,"This phase I clinical trial tests the immune effects of fermented wheat germ in patients with advanced solid tumor cancers who are being treated with standard of care checkpoint inhibitors. Fermented wheat germ is a nutritional supplement that some claim is a ""dietary food for special medical purposes for cancer patients"" to support them in treatment. There have also been claims that fermented wheat germ is ""clinically proven"" and ""recognized by medical experts"" to ""enhance oncological treatment"" and boost immune response to cancer; however, there are currently no documented therapeutic effects of fermented wheat germ as a nutritional supplement. Checkpoint inhibitors, given as part of standard of care for advanced solid tumors, are a type of immunotherapy that may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The information gained from this trial may allow researchers to determine if there is any value of giving fermented wheat germ with standard of care checkpoint inhibitors for patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.",RECRUITING,2023-06-02,"Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma, Advanced Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma, Advanced Malignant Solid Neoplasm, Advanced Melanoma, Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma, Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma, Anatomic Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Anatomic Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Clinical Stage III Cutaneous Melanoma AJCC v8, Clinical Stage IV Cutaneous Melanoma AJCC v8, Stage III Colorectal Cancer AJCC v8, Stage III Lung Cancer AJCC v8, Stage III Renal Cell Cancer AJCC v8, Stage IV Colorectal Cancer AJCC v8, Stage IV Lung Cancer AJCC v8, Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer AJCC v8",Fermented Wheat Germ Extract,Sacramento / California / United States,No contact listed,2025-06-02,2023-08-01,2023-08-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,"Inclusion Criteria:

164,NCT05554354,Unknown,Testing the Use of Fulvestrant and Binimetinib Targeted Treatment for NF1 Mutation in Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (A ComboMATCH Treatment Trial),"This phase II ComboMATCH treatment trial compares the usual treatment alone (fulvestrant) to using binimetinib plus the usual treatment in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer that has spread from where it first started to other places in the body (metastatic) and has an NF1 genetic change. Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that binds to estrogen receptors in tumor cells, resulting in estrogen receptor destruction and decreased estrogen binding, which may inhibit the growth of estrogen-sensitive tumor cells. Binimetinib is a targeted therapy that may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The addition of binimetinib to fulvestrant in breast cancers with an NF1 genetic change could increase the percentage of tumors that shrink as well as lengthen the time that the tumors remain stable (without progression) as compared to fulvestrant alone.",RECRUITING,2024-05-29,"Anatomic Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v8, Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Carcinoma, Metastatic Hormone Receptor-Positive

* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. History of other active malignancy requiring treatment within the last 3 years or bone marrow dysplasia such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is not allowed
* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association functional classification. To be eligible for this study, patients should be class 2B or better
* Concomitant use of bisphosphonates or denosumab is required (except if medical contraindication such as hypocalcemia or concern for osteonecrosis of the jaw). If not already on bone modifying agents, patient must initiate such therapy within one month before start of study treatment
* The effects of radium-223 dichloride on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because alpha particle-emitting radiopharmaceutical agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Pre-menopausal subjects as well as subjects with ovarian radiation or concomitant treatment with an luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist/antagonist must have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use an adequate method of contraception as recommended by their treating physicians. Subjects of child-bearing potential who are sexually active and their male partners must agree to utilize, during the treatment period and for 6 months after last dose of radium-223 dichloride, 2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception used simultaneously: a) barrier method such as a) condoms (male or female) with spermicidal agent or b) diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, combined with a highly effective non-hormonal birth control method such as an intra-uterine device. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception and not donate sperm prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of radium-223 dichloride
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible
* No prior paclitaxel in metastatic setting within 2 years prior to radium-223 dichloride start. No prior paclitaxel in adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting within 6 months prior to radium-223 dichloride start

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patients with peripheral neuropathy \> grade 1
* Patients who have not recovered from AEs due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \> grade 1) with the exception of alopecia
* Patients who have had chemotherapy or immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor within 4 weeks prior to treatment. Patient who receives radiation therapy or hormone therapy within 2 weeks prior to treatment are excluded. For patients on trial therapy prior to study enrollment, washout period of 6 times the half-life of previously administered investigational agents prior to starting radium-223 dichloride is required
* Prior therapy with radionuclides (e.g., strontium, samarium, rhenium, radium)
* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Vaccination for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is allowed as well as any therapy as required for the treatment of active coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection
* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to radium-223 dichloride or other agents used in study
* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radium-223 dichloride is an alpha particle-emitting radiopharmaceutical agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with radium-223 dichloride, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with radium-223 dichloride. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study
* Imminent/established spinal cord compression, pathological fracture in weight bearing bones or bone lesion with soft tissue component unless treated as appropriate with radiation and/or surgery before starting on trial

174,NCT04266249,Unknown,CompassHER2-pCR: Decreasing Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer Patients After Pre-surgery Chemo and Targeted Therapy,"This trial studies how well paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab work in eliminating further chemotherapy after surgery in patients with HER2-positive stage II-IIIa breast cancer who have no cancer remaining at surgery (either in the breast or underarm lymph nodes) after pre-operative chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are both a form of ""targeted therapy"" because they work by attaching themselves to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When these drugs attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Giving paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab may enable fewer chemotherapy drugs to be given without compromising patient outcomes compared to the usual treatment.",RECRUITING,2020-03-13,"Anatomic

176,NCT05078398,POINT-B,Postoperative Opt-In Narcotics Treatment in Breast,"In a recent study, researchers let patients choose what medications to go home with after endocrine surgery. This has not been done in outpatient breast surgery, though several institutions have moved towards avoiding opioids altogether after breast surgery. These institutions only prescribed rescue opioids upon request.

The aim of this study is to compare a similar ""opt-in"" protocol for narcotics to usual care (where patients are routinely discharged with opioids) for outpatient breast surgery.

This study will be designed as a randomized, controlled trial. When adult patients consent for outpatient breast surgery, the patients will be asked to participate in the study. Patients who are currently using narcotics would be excluded. The investigators would then randomize participants to the ""opt-in"" protocol versus being provided with a standard opioid prescription after surgery. Patients in the opt-in protocol will be recommended a pain treatment regimen with over-the-counter medications, acetaminophen or ibuprofen. These patients will be reassured that if their pain is uncontrolled after discharge, a narcotic prescription will be called in to their pharmacy if requested.

The investigators will assess patient pain scores and medication use in the recovery area using the electronic medical record. The investigators will collect data on patient pain scores and medication use after discharge on a daily basis via phone call or electronically transmitted survey.

Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the patient's immune system.

This trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy with avelumab. One treatment, sacituzumab Govitecan, is a monoclonal antibody called sacituzumab linked to a chemotherapy drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them. Another treatment, liposomal doxorubicin, is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tiny, fat-like particles. It may have fewer side effects and work better than doxorubicin, and may enhance factors associated with immune response. The third medication is called binimetinib, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the immune system. It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.",RECRUITING,2019-07-08,"Stage III Breast Cancer, Stage IIIA Breast Cancer, Stage IIIB Breast Cancer, Stage IIIC Breast Cancer, Stage IV Breast Cancer, Invasive Breast Carcinoma, Recurrent Breast Carcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma, Unresectable Breast Carcinoma","Anti-OX40 Antibody PF-04518600, Avelumab, Binimetinib, Utomilumab, Liposomal Doxorubicin, Sacituzumab Govitecan","Birmingham / Alabama / United States, San Francisco / California / United States, Washington / District of Columbia / United States, Evergreen Park / Illinois / United States, Baltimore / Maryland / United States, Boston / Massachusetts / United States, Rochester / Minnesota / United States, Chapel Hill / North Carolina / United States, Durham / North Carolina / United States, Philadelphia / Pennsylvania / United States, Nashville / Tennessee / United States, Houston / Texas / United States","Hope Rugo, MD -  CONTACT - 877-827-3222 - No Phone Ext - cancertrials@ucsf.edu, Amy Langdon -  CONTACT - 415-353-7288 - No Phone Ext - Amy.Deluca@ucsf.edu",2025-06-30,2019-06-03,2024-05-13,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,"Inclusion Criteria:

* Dose Escalation: To investigate the safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of DS-1062a
* Dose Expansion: To investigate the safety and tolerability of DS-1062a in additional solid tumors

This study is expected to last approximately 6 years from the time the first participant is enrolled to the time the last subject is off the study. Study sites are located in both the United States and Japan.

The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants who continue to benefit from the study treatment may continue, unless:

* they withdraw
* their disease gets worse
* they experience unacceptable side effects.

The primary purpose of the sub-study is to compare the effectiveness of steroid versus non-steroid mouthwash as prophylaxis against oral mucositis/stomatitis in participants receiving DS-1062a.

The sub-study is a randomized study that will include approximately 76 participants enrolling into the Dose Expansion part.",RECRUITING,2018-01-31,"Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer, Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), Steroid Containing Mouthwash, Non-Steroid Containing Mouthwash","Los Angeles / California / United States, Washington / District of Columbia / United States, Atlanta / Georgia / United States, Baltimore / Maryland / United States, Boston / Massachusetts / United States, Boston / Massachusetts / United States, New York / New York / United States, New York / New York / United States, Nashville / Tennessee / United States, Houston / Texas / United States, San Antonio / Texas / United States, San Antonio / Texas / United States, Fairfax / Virginia / United States, Nagoya / Aichi / Japan, Koto-Ku / Tokyo / Japan, Shinagawa-Ku / Tokyo / Japan, Chuo-Ku / No State / Japan, Kashiwa / No State / Japan","(For Asia sites only) Daiichi Sankyo Contact for Clinical Trial Information -  CONTACT - +81-3-6225-1111(M-F 9-5 JST) - No Phone Ext - dsclinicaltrial@daiichisankyo.co.jp, (For US sites) Daiichi Sankyo Contact for Clinical Trial Information -  CONTACT - 908-992-6400 - No Phone Ext - CTRinfo@dsi.com",2025-01-01,2018-01-17,2023-06-18,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,"Inclusion Criteria

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. There is some evidence from previous clinical trials that people who have a MammaPrint Ultrahigh Risk result may be more likely to respond to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

199,NCT05564377,Unknown,"Targeted Therapy Directed by Genetic Testing in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Advanced Solid Tumors, The ComboMATCH Screening Trial",This ComboMATCH patient screening trial is the gateway to a coordinated set of clinical trials to study cancer treatment directed by genetic testing. Patients with solid tumors that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or have spread to other places in the body (advanced) and have progressed on at least one line of standard systemic therapy or have no standard treatment that has been shown to prolong overall survival may be candidates for these trials. Genetic tests look at the unique genetic material (genes) of patients' tumor cells. Patients with some genetic changes or abnormalities (mutations) may benefit from treatment that targets that particular genetic mutation. ComboMATCH is designed to match patients to a treatment that may work to control their tumor and may help doctors plan better treatment for patients with locally advanced or advanced solid
