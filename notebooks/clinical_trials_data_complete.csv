   Cohort 3B: EGFR wild-type NSCLC: Patients have received platinum-containing chemotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies as the only prior line of therapy; Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant system therapy/ radical chemoradiotherapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 6 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.

   Cohort 4: GC or GEJC: Patients who have been treated with only one prior therapy of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies therapy and progressed during or after treatment. Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant system therapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 6 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.

   Cohort 5: Second-line ES-SCLC: Patients who must have progressed on or after treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies administrated as part of first-line platinum-based systemic therapy for ES-SCLC. Previously treated limited stage SCLC will not be eligible.

   Cohort 6: HR+/ HER2-BC : Patients who have received previously at least two and no more than four lines of chemotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease with at least one taxane-containing in any setting. Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patients progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 12 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Patients should also have previously presented a progression on anticancer hormonal therapy with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and/ or a relapse during or after adjuvant endocrine therapy combined with an approved CDK4/6 inhibitor in this setting. Note: 1) Patients with HR+/HER2-BC and visceral crisis will be excluded. 2) For patients who have known BRCA mutation and HR+/HER2-BC, prior PARP inhibitor is required before enrolled in this study (where available and not medically contraindicated). 3) For patients with unknown BRCA status, prior PARP inhibitor is not required. 4) Patients who previously received therapy with an anti- HER2 ADC (T-Dxd) for HER2 low expressing tumors are eligible and this therapy will count as one chemotherapy line for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.

   Cohort 7: HNSCC: Patients who have been previously treated with therapy of anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies (either as a single-agent or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy) as first-line treatment in recurrent/metastatic (R/M) setting and progressed during or after treatment. Prior definitive/multimodal therapy for locally advanced (LA) HNSCC that included anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and platinum therapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed during or within 6 months of completing definitive therapy.

   Cohort 8: Endometrial cancer: Patients who have previously failed with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy; patients with microsatellite stability/non-mismatch repair deficiency (MSS/pMMR) endometrial carcinoma must have received prior platinum-based therapy and progressed during or after treatment. Patients with known high microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficiency (MSI-H/dMMR) endometrial carcinoma must have received prior platinum-based therapy and anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies therapy and progressed during or after treatment. Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 12 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Note: 1) If anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies therapy is not approved for second-line treatment for MSI-H/dMMR endometrial cancer patients in certain regions, prior treatment with anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies is not required. 2) If MMR/MSI status is unknown, patients who have been only treated with platinum based therapy is acceptable.

   Cohort 9: UC: Patients who have failed with prior first-line platinum-based therapy and received prior anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibodies therapy and progressed during or after the latest treatment. Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant system therapy would be counted as a line of therapy if the patient progressed to unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease during or within 12 months after completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.

The regional lymph nodes can be cN0, cN1, or cN2a.

Histological grade II or III tumor.

Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (mammogram, ultrasound, and/or MRI) within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy. If suspicious or abnormal, FNA or core biopsy is recommended, also within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy. Findings of these evaluations will be used to determine the nodal status prior to initiating chemotherapy.

* Nodal status - negative: Imaging of the axilla is negative; Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but the FNA or core biopsy of the questionable node(s) on imaging is negative;
* Nodal status - positive: FNA or core biopsy of the node(s) is cytologically or histologically suspicious or positive. Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but FNA or core biopsy was not performed.

Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have ER and progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis assessed by current ASCO/CAP Guidelines. Patients are eligible with either hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-negative tumors.

Tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis must have been determined to be HER2-negative as follows:

* Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+; or
* IHC 2+ and in situ hybridization (ISH) non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) less than 2.0, and if reported, average HER2 gene copy number less than 4 signals/cells; or
* ISH non-amplified with a ratio of HER2 to CEP17 less than 2.0, and if reported, average HER2 gene copy number less than 4 signals/cells.

Blood counts performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy must meet the following criteria:

* absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal 1200/mm3;
* platelet count must be greater than or equal 100,000/mm3; and

* alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and
* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.
* Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, the AST must be less than or equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, the alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to ULN. Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.

Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET-CT, or PET scan) performed within 6 weeks prior to initiating chemotherapy does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements in next criteria are met.

  * Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone:

    * If pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN0 or pN1b;
    * If pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN1mi or pN1a and the patient has undergone breast conserving surgery (with planned breast radiotherapy), the primary tumor must be T1 or T2 by pathologic evaluation and the nodal involvement must be limited to 1 or 2 positive nodes
  * Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes if the sentinel node (SN) is positive; or
  * Axillary lymphadenectomy with or without SN isolation procedure
* The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer (including re-excision of margins) and randomization must be no more than 60 days
* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to1200/mm\^3
* Platelet count must be greater than or equal 100,000/mm\^3
* Hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 10 g/dL
* Adequate hepatic function must be met based on the results of the most recent postoperative tests performed with 6 weeks prior to randomization.
* Total bilirubin must be less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory (lab) unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin
* Alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab

  * Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.
* Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography \[CT\], magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\], positron emission tomography \[PET\]-CT, or PET scan) performed within 90 days prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements above are met
* Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN or unexplained bone pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT scan, or PET scan performed within 90 days prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease
* Adequate renal function determined within 6 weeks prior to randomization defined as the most recent serum creatinine less than or equal to ULN or measured or calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min
* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment must be performed within 90 days prior to randomization; (LVEF assessment performed by 2-dimensional \[D\] echocardiogram is preferred; however, multi gated acquisition \[MUGA\] scan may be substituted based on institutional preferences;) the LVEF must be greater than or equal to 50% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal.

Exclusion Criteria:

* T4 tumors including inflammatory breast cancer
* Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease; required imaging studies must have been performed within 90 days prior to randomization

* Any previous history of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer or ipsilateral DCIS; (patients with synchronous or previous ipsilateral LCIS are eligible)
* History of non-breast malignancies (except for in situ cancers treated only by local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 5 years prior to randomization
* Previous therapy with anthracyclines or taxanes for any malignancy
* Chemotherapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization
* Any continued use of sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormone replacement therapy; patients are eligible if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization

* Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is required between end of radiotherapy
* Participants may have previously undergone surgical resection
* Age \>= 12 years. Patients 12-17 years of age must be \> 40 kg at enrollment. Patients 12-17 years of age will not participate in the mandatory tumor biopsies. Since there is no data on patients less than 18 years of age, this population may require lower doses and additional safety precautions and should be closely monitored. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of ZEN003694 in combination with abemaciclib in patients \<12 years of age, younger children are excluded from this study
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\< 2 for participants \>= 16 years of age, Lansky \>= 50% if \< 16 years of age
* Hemoglobin \>= 8 g/dL; Patients may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve this hemoglobin level at the discretion of the investigator. Initial treatment must not begin earlier than the day after the erythrocyte transfusion

* Patients should be New York Heart Association Functional Classification of class 2B or better
* Ability to swallow and retain oral medications
* The effects of ZEN00364 and abemaciclib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because BETi and CDKi-inhibiting agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men and women treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 weeks after completion of ZEN003694 and abemaciclib administration

  * For female subjects of child-bearing potentially receiving ZEN003694, hormonal means of birth control alone, such as oral, injectable, dermal, subdermal or topical contraceptives are NOT acceptable forms of birth control given that their efficacy has not been evaluated when given in combination with the investigational drugs. ""Adequate contraception"" is defined as the following:

    * Contraceptive methods with a failure rate of =\< 1% used in combination with the barrier method. The following contraceptive methods are acceptable to use in combination with the barrier method: intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine system (IUS), or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) that meet the \< 1% failure rate as stated in the product label. Note: Hormonal IUDs/OCPs may only be used if the following criteria are met: male condoms are required AND subjects are informed of the potential for reduced systemic hormone levels from the IUD/OCP when taking ZEN003694. Alternatively, male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject. For this definition, ""documented"" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records
  * Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must use one of the following contraceptive methods:

    * Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia OR
    * Condom use PLUS partner use of a highly effective contraceptive (=\< 1% rate of failure per year) such as intrauterine device or system, or hormonal birth control such as contraceptive subdermal implant, combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive, injectable progestogen, contraceptive vaginal ring, or percutaneous contraceptive patches
  * Male subjects should not donate sperm while on study and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study medication. Male subjects whose partners are or become pregnant must continue to use condoms for 12 weeks after the last dose of study medication
* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of starting treatment
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available may be eligible after discussion with the Principal Investigator of this study. There will be a separate assent process for minors

Exclusion Criteria:

* Participants who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or other investigational therapy within 2 weeks prior to entering the study. There is a two week required washout period for previous BET inhibitor therapy
* Participants who have had radiotherapy within at least 2 weeks prior to entering the study. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) within 1 week prior to entering the study will be allowed
* Participants who have had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to entering the study
* Participants who have received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or small molecules within 5 half-lives or 1 week (whichever is shorter) of study entry
* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents
* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ZEN003694 or abemaciclib
* Patients requiring medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP3A enzymes are ineligible. Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694 and abemaciclib. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to: ongoing or active infection requiring systemic therapy, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment (e.g. estimated creatinine clearance \< 30ml/min), history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline grade 2 or higher diarrhea that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study
* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic windows are ineligible. Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. As proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids may alter the pharmacokinetics of ZEN003694 by reducing ZEN003694 exposure, patients receiving proton pump inhibitors are ineligible. If H2 blockers or other acid reducing agents are used concomitantly with ZEN003694, a staggered dosing schedule should be used. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZEN003694 is a BETi agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ZEN003694, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ZEN003694. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study
* Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) \>= 450 msec on screening electrocardiogram (ECG) (machine or manual read allowed). Patients should avoid medications which prolong the QT
* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are Factor Xa inhibitors (i.e., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban otamixaban, letaxaban, eribaxaban) or Factor IIa inhibitors (i.e., dabigatran). Low molecular weight heparin is allowed
* Patients with radiation to \> 25% of the bone marrow
* Patients who have had a bone-targeted radionuclide within 6 weeks of the first dose of ZEN003694
* Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to the first dose of ZEN003694
* Impairment of gastrointestinal function that may significantly alter the absorption of ZEN003694 and/or abemaciclib
* The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest",ALL,12 Years,Unknown

  * Systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent corticosteroid
  * Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan premedication).
* Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS metastases. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. A negative serum pregnancy test is required no more than 7 days before study entry.
* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \[anti-HBc\] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).
* The patient with a previous history of non-breast malignancy is eligible for this study only if the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer survivor is eligible provided the following criteria are met:

  * Patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies.
  * Patients have been considered disease free for at least 1 year (with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix).
* Patients with a strong likelihood of non-adherence (such as difficulties in adhering to follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the treatment facility) should not be knowingly registered.

* If imaging, after review with a radiologist, is low probability for metastatic disease, patients may proceed to randomization.
* Patients with suspicious but inconclusive imaging results should undergo a diagnostic biopsy, if biopsy is negative patients are eligible for randomization.
* Patients with positive imaging that is conclusive of metastatic disease, or with biopsy proven metastatic disease, are not eligible for randomization.

  * Patients with clinical T4 or N3 disease are not eligible
* Patient must be willing and able (i.e., have no contraindication) to receive standard adjuvant therapy, consisting of HER2-directed therapy, radiation (if indicated) and endocrine therapy (if ER+) if achieving pCR at surgery
* Patient with bilateral invasive breast cancers are eligible if both cancers are HER2-positive (as defined in 3.1.3) at least one meets protocol eligibility and neither cancer renders the patient ineligible (i.e. per eligibility 3.1.5)
* Patients with multiple ipsilateral invasive tumors are eligible as long as all tumors are HER2-positive, and at least one tumor focus meets eligibility criteria (per eligibility 3.1.5). Multiple lesions that appear part of the same index tumor do not require additional biopsy/HER2 testing. Multiple lesions that appear part of the same index tumor do not require additional biopsy/HER2 testing. However, even if biopsy is not deemed necessary, consideration should be given to placing a clip in any lesion that is 1 cm or further from the primary tumor to ensure that all tumor is removed at surgery AND that the pathologist can locate all primary sites of tumor to assess pathologic response at surgery.
* Patients with a history of other non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years, and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.

  * Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and localized papillary or follicular thyroid cancer who have completed recommended treatment including surgery. Patients with any other cancers within the last 5 years are ineligible.
* Patents must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within normal institutional parameters (or \> 50%)
* Patients must not have \> grade 1 peripheral neuropathy of any etiology.
* Patients must have a bilateral mammogram and a diagnostic breast ultrasound \[on the side of the cancer(s)\] (with or without breast MRI) performed at screening. An axillary ultrasound on the side of the cancer(s) is also required. However, if a patient has a negative axillary physical exam and a baseline MRI without suspicious lymph nodes performed before axillary ultrasound, axillary ultrasound may be omitted. Comprehensive breast and axillary imaging must be performed within 42 days of registration (i.e. the patient's mammogram/ breast ultrasound /axillary ultrasound OR their breast MRI).
* Baseline imaging of the ipsilateral axilla by ultrasound or breast MRI is mandatory. For subjects with axillary lymph node(s) suspicious on clinical exam or imaging, patient must be willing to have a needle aspiration or core biopsy to determine the presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes. A clip must be placed in the involved axillary lymph node. (If there are more than 1 suspicious axillary nodes, only one clipped node is required).
* Patient of childbearing potential and sexually active patients must use accepted and effective method(s) of contraception or to abstain from sexual intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study and for 7 months after the last dose of study treatment.
* Patient must be willing and able to sign informed consent
* Leukocytes \>= 3,000/mcL (obtained =\< 28 days prior to protocol registration)
* Absolute neutrophil count \>= 1,500/mcL (obtained =\< 28 days prior to protocol registration)
* Platelets \>= 100,000/mcL (obtained =\< 28 days prior to protocol registration)
* Total bilirubin =\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (obtained =\< 28 days prior to protocol registration)
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase \[SGOT\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \[SGPT\]) =\< 2.5 x institutional ULN (obtained =\< 28 days prior to protocol registration)
* Creatinine =\< 1.5 x institutional ULN (obtained =\< 28 days prior to protocol registration)
* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial
* For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated
* Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patients must not have impaired decision-making capacity
* Patient must not have a history of any prior (ipsilateral or contralateral) invasive breast cancer

  * One exception: a patient with a history of T1N0 triple negative breast cancer diagnosed more than 10 years earlier, who remains disease free is eligible
* Patient must not have prior ipsilateral ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Patients with prior lobular breast carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical hyperplasia, other high risk benign lesions or contralateral DCIS (without evidence of microinvasion) are eligible

  * NOTE: Patients currently receiving endocrine therapy for prior contralateral DCIS are eligible
* Patient must not have stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer

  * Staging studies (computed tomography \[CT\] chest/abdomen/pelvis and a bone scan or positron emission tomography \[PET\]-CT scan) are required for stage III disease or those with abnormal baseline liver function tests (LFTs), symptoms (e.g. new bone pain) or abnormal physical exam findings (National Comprehensive Cancer Network \[NCCN\] guidelines version \[V\]1.2019)
* Patient must not have T4 and/or N3 disease, including inflammatory breast cancer
* Patient must not have any prior treatment for the current breast cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation or experimental therapy

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody agent, ASTX727 is a hypomethylating agent, and paclitaxel is a class D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab (MK-3475), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 180 days after completion of study treatment.

* HER2-positive status will be based on pretreatment biopsy material and defined as an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ and/or positive by in situ hybridization (ISH) according to current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Central testing is not required

  \* Known hormone receptor (HR) status as defined by ASCO/CAP guidelines (based on pretreatment biopsy material). Hormone receptor positive status can be determined by either known positive estrogen receptor (ER) or known positive progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor negative status must be determined by both known negative ER and known negative PR
* Patients with clinical stage T1-4, N0-3 disease at presentation and residual invasive disease postoperatively as defined above are eligible. (Note: Patients with T1a/bN0 tumors are not eligible at initial breast cancer diagnosis are not eligible)
* Patients with residual HR-negative, HER2 positive (+) disease in the breast and/or lymph nodes per the surgical pathology report are eligible; however, patients with HR+ HER2+ cancers must have node-positive residual disease per the surgical pathology report in order to qualify for the study. The presence of residual invasive disease in the breast is not mandatory for these patients
* Patients with weakly ER-positive (1-10%) breast cancer (based on the pretreatment core biopsy) are eligible even if they have node-negative disease per the surgical pathology report
* The residual disease tissue (breast and/or lymph nodes) is not required to be HER2-positive, as eligibility for NCI-2020-03770 (A011801) is based on a positive HER2 status at the time of the initial breast cancer diagnosis

  \* Note: The presence of micrometastases in lymph nodes after preoperative therapy counts as residual disease, whereas the presence of isolated tumor cells does not
* Patients with synchronous bilateral invasive disease are eligible provided both lesions were confirmed to be HER2-positive, and at least one of the lesions meets the criteria outlined above. Multifocal disease is allowed, as long as the largest biopsied breast tumor was HER2-positive
* Patients must have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with one of the following regimens: docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (THP), paclitaxel/methotrexate/cisplatin (TMP), doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (AC-TH(P)); docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (TCH(P)); fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide-docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (FAC-TH(P)), or fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide-docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab (FEC-TH(P)). Note: apart from TCHP, where T is docetaxel, treatment with docetaxel or paclitaxel is acceptable
* Prior receipt of T-DM1 in the neoadjuvant setting is not allowed.

  * Prior treatment must have consisted of \>= 6 cycles of chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy, with a total duration of \>= 12 weeks, including at least 9 weeks of preoperative taxane and trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab (or Food and Drug Administration \[FDA\]-approved biosimilars). Patients who have received at least 9 weeks of preoperative taxane, pertuzumab and margetuximab are also eligible if they received \>= 6 cycles of systemic therapy prior to enrollment. Note: Patients who complete at least nine of a planned twelve doses of weekly paclitaxel, or three of a planned four doses of docetaxel, but discontinue prematurely due to toxicity are eligible. Patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy regimens are also eligible. Prior use of nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) instead of paclitaxel or docetaxel is permitted. Prior use of subcutaneous trastuzumab (Hylecta) and subcutaneous trastuzumab and pertuzumab (Phesgo) is also allowed.
  * Patients who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy which included experimental HER2-targeted therapy/therapies are potentially eligible, as long as the investigational agent was not a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (e.g. T-DM1, DS-8201a \[trastuzumab deruxtecan\]) or a HER2 targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g. tucatinib, lapatinib, neratinib).
* Patients may have received =\< 1 cycles of T-DM1 in the adjuvant setting. Note: These patients will be randomized to receive a further 14 cycles of T-DM1 and tucatinib/placebo as tolerated. The most recent cycle of T-DM1 should have been administered =\< 5 weeks prior to registration

  \* Note: Both of the following two criteria need to be met for the patient to be eligible for this study
  * An interval of no more than 12 weeks between the completion date of the last definitive treatment (e.g. postoperative chemotherapy or radiation, or if neither given, breast surgical date) and the date of registration. Concurrent radiation therapy is permitted while receiving study treatment
  * Patients must be registered on study within =\< 180 days of the date of the most recent definitive breast cancer surgery (not including reconstructive surgery)
* All systemic chemotherapy should have been completed preoperatively unless participating in EA1181 (CompassHER2 pathologic complete response \[pCR\]) or the BIG DECRESCENDO Trial (which is very similar to CompassHER2 pCR in terms of study design, drugs, and eligibility). However, patients who received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant THP off study can receive a further 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy postoperatively to meet eligibility for A011801. Patients who participated in EA1181 or MA41 and proceeded to surgery immediately after the de-escalated trial regimen must receive postoperative chemotherapy to complete a total of \>= 6 cycles of systemic treatment prior to enrollment on A011801, as outlined above (e.g. 4 cycles pre-operatively, and 2 cycles post-operatively). The postoperative chemotherapy regimen prescribed is at the discretion of the treating oncologist (i.e. 2-4 cycles AC or THP, other). Continuation of trastuzumab + pertuzumab (HP) pre- or post-operatively as maintenance therapy (while awaiting a surgical date or an official pathology report) is allowed for all study participants
* Toxicities related to prior systemic treatment should have resolved or be at baseline, apart from alopecia and peripheral neuropathy =\< grade 1
* Adequate excision: surgical removal of all clinically evident disease in the breast and lymph nodes as follows:

  * Breast surgery: total mastectomy with no gross residual disease at the margin of resection, or breast-conserving surgery with histologically negative margins of excision
  * For patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. Patients with margins positive for classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection
  * Lymph node surgery \*\* The axilla needs to be evaluated with either sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection. If patients have a sentinel lymph node biopsy and sentinel nodes are negative, no further axillary treatment is necessary. If patients have isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in the setting of residual breast disease, at least one of the following is required: axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or planned nodal irradiation. If patients have micro- or macro-metastatic nodal disease, ALND and planned nodal irradiation are required. Of note, co-enrollment on Alliance A011202 is not allowed
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>= 1,000/mm\^3
* Hemoglobin \>= 8 g/dL (Note: packed red blood cells \[PRBC\] transfusion is not permitted to achieve eligibility)
* Platelet count \>= 100,000/mm\^3
* Creatinine =\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
* Total bilirubin =\< 1.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or direct bilirubin within the institutional normal range for patients with Gilbert's syndrome
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =\< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
* Screening left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \>= 50% on echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and no decrease in LVEF by more than 15% absolute percentage points from the pre-chemotherapy LVEF. Or, if pre-chemotherapy LVEF was not assessed, the screening LVEF must be \>= 55% after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Note: LVEF assessment may be repeated once up to 3 weeks following the initial screening assessment to assess eligibility

Exclusion Criteria:

* No adjuvant treatment with any anti-cancer investigational drug within 28 days prior to registration
* Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects. Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative serum pregnancy test done =\< 7 days prior to registration is required
* Patients with known active and/or untreated hepatitis B or hepatitis C or chronic liver disease are ineligible. Patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis B or C that has been treated and cleared and normal liver function are eligible to participate in the study if the other eligibility parameters are met

    (b) Untreated brain metastases not needing immediate local therapy

    (c) Previously treated brain metastases
    1. Brain metastases previously treated with local therapy may either be stable since treatment or may have progressed since prior local CNS therapy, provided that there is no clinical indication for immediate re-treatment with local therapy
    2. Participants treated with CNS local therapy for newly identified lesions or previously treated and progressing lesions may be eligible to enroll if all of the following criteria are met:

Prior treatment with lapatinib or neratinib within 12 months of starting study treatment (except in cases where they were given for ≤21 days and was discontinued for reasons other than disease progression or severe toxicity). Prior treatment with pyrotinib for recurrent of mBC (except in cases where pyrotinib was given for ≤21 days and was discontinued for reasons other than disease progression or severe toxicity).
  * CNS Exclusion - Based on screening contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), participants must not have any of the following:
