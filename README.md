## Inspiration

Finding relevant clinical trials is a daunting task for patients, often relying solely on doctor recommendations which may not encompass all available options. Similarly, as a busy doctor or clinical research assistant providing healthcare and facilitating clinical trials, it's challenging to adequately educate patients amidst juggling multiple trials, or get in touch with patients who could benefit from participation but are not within their immediate reach. 

SimpleTrials addresses these hurdles by offering simplified, easy-to-understand modules, empowering patients to explore trial information independently. By bridging the gap between patients and trials with clear language and accessible resources, SimpleTrials enhances patient autonomy and facilitates informed decision-making in healthcare journeys. Moreover, by enabling patients to find trials, SimpleTrials contributes to accelerating clinical research, enhancing speed, and overall participant experience, thereby driving innovation in healthcare.

Special thanks to my friend Annie, who is working as a clinical research coordinator at UCSF, for discussing the project idea with me :)

## What it does

SimpleTrials is a clinical trial dashboard designed to empower users without medical education background in navigating and understanding the clinical trials. 

The journey begins with users inputting search parameters such as their condition of interest, type of intervention, or preferred location. The default settings prioritize ongoing trials, allowing patients to explore immediately available options. 

Results are then categorized into three main sections. Firstly, the Data Summary provides users with essential insights into the trials, including study type, phase, sex requirements distribution, and trial locations, offering a visual overview to navigate the trial information. Next, the Filter and Explore trials feature enables users to interact directly with the data, allowing for trial shortlisting and column filtering based on specific keywords, with key information regarding study aims and eligibility criteria readily accessible. Finally, users can engage with Language Model Models (LLMs) agents - summarizer and comparator - to simplify complex trial information, with options to learn about individual trials, receive summaries of eligibility criteria, the point of contact for each trial, and compare two trials using their NCT IDs. These features empower patients to make informed choices and explore potential trial participation.


## What's next for SimpleTrials
Enhanced User Experience: To further reduce barriers to understanding, SimpleTrials should allow easy search of specific terms on the page, empowering users with greater comprehension. Additionally, enabling users to save previous explorations and LLM-generated summaries will streamline their journey.

Seamless Patient-Provider Contact: We aim to facilitate direct communication between patients and trial providers by implementing a single-button contact feature. This will allow patients to easily reach out to trial managers via email or phone directly from the trial details page, fostering seamless engagement.

Deeper Analytics: Introducing custom scoring mechanisms to quantify patient burden will enable us to assess the complexity of trials more comprehensively. By evaluating criteria related to personal information and clinical lab data, we can identify potential barriers to trial participation and assist in streamlining trial designs. These analytics tools will not only benefit patients by identifying suitable trials but also aid researchers, trial designers, and healthcare professionals in optimizing trial protocols and understanding trial landscapes more effectively.
